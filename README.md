# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Title: QACinemas

**Project Description:** Creating a full stack application allowing users to book a ticket, make a purchase and browse the site with ease.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine
for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
See Admin folder for Risk Assessment, presentation and Acceptance Criteria snapshots.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

MongoDB,
Visual Studio Code,
Postman,
Express,
React,
Node.

### Installing

MongoDB: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

Visual Studio Code: https://www.code.visualstudio.com/download

NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Postman: https://www.postman.com/downloads/ (Underneath 'Start Something new' you should be able to 'Create a request', enter the end-point of the URL you are looking to access data from. E,g https://localhost2021/create/penguin).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

**npm** & **npx**

**npm** > Used to install packages, whilst

**npx** > Used to execute packages.

**For example:** _npx create-react-app Name_Of_Project_ (Will begin the creation of your react app) and then
running _npm start_ in the terminal.

**npm start**

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**npm install**

Installs all of the relevant dependencies that will be needed,
to run the application.

Different ways to install: '_npm install --save_' OR '_npm i --save_'.
Adding '_-dev_' after '_--save_' if the dependency you're installing is a development tool

**For example:** npm install PACKAGE_NAME

For more information: https://www.npmjs.com/

**npm test**

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

**npm run build**

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

**npm run eject**
Note: this is a one-way operation. **Once you eject, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

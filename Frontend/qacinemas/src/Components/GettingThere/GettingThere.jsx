            <h5>BY TUBE</h5>
            <h5> Covent Garden is on the Piccadilly Line. Covent Garden's tube station is a very short walk from the Market Building at the end of James Street. Covent Garden underground station only has lifts up from the platforms so it can be slow-going at busy times. During peak times we suggest getting off at Leicester Square (Piccadilly and Northern Line),
                 which is a short walk to Covent Garden.</h5>
            <br></br>
            <h5>BY RAIL</h5>
            <h5>Covent Garden is conveniently located close to two London stations. The nearest being Charing Cross, which is a couple of minutesâ€™ walk away. The other is Waterloo station, which is a twenty-minute walk across the iconic Waterloo Bridge with great views over London. </h5>
            <br></br>
            <h5>BY BUS</h5>
            <h5>The 9, 13, 15, 23, 139 and 153 all stop at Trafalgar Square and Aldwych (both a short walk from the Market Building). The No. 24 stops at Leicester Square; Covent Garden is signposted from there.</h5>
